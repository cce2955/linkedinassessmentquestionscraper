This code scrapes the current question from the quiz you are taking on a linked in assessment. It works for question, answer, and code blocks and organizes them by section to paste somewhere else for future reference.

To use create a new bookmark, paste the code from bookmarklet in address, and while you're taking a linkedin assessment tap the bookmark and the question will be in your clipboard.

Why do you need this code? well this is purely for educational purposes I'm not sure why you're asking me
